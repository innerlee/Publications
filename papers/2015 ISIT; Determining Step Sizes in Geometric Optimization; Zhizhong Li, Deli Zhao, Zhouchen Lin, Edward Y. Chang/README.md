# Determining step sizes in geometric optimization algorithms

Zhizhong Li, Deli Zhao, Zhouchen Lin, Edward Y. Chang


Optimization on Riemannian manifolds is an intuitive generalization of the traditional 
optimization algorithms in Euclidean spaces. In these algorithms, minimizing along a 
search direction becomes minimizing along a search curve lying on a manifold. Computing 
such a curve to be subsequently searched upon is itself computational intensive. 
We propose a new minimization scheme aiming to find a better step size utilizing the 
first order information of the search curve. We prove that this scheme can provide 
further reduction for the cost function when the retraction and the vector transport 
are collinear. Then we adapt this scheme to propose a heuristic strategy for line search. 
In numerical experiments, we apply this heuristic strategy to one of the geometric 
algorithms for matrix completion and show its feasibility and the potential in 
accelerating computation.
